## OpenWRT build's

These are built using https://github.com/Ogglord/openwrt-builder and based on pesa1234's excellent work https://github.com/pesa1234/MT6000_cust_build/tree/main

Note to self - I executed this to be able to push large commits
```bash
git config --global http.postBuffer 572864000
```
